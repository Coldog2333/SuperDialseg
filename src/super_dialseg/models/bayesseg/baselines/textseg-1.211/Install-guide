The package (textseg-1.21.tar.gz) is available from
http://www.crl.go.jp/jt/a132/members/mutiyama/software.html

Before using this package, if you want to segment English texts, 
you need C99-1.2-release.tgz, which is available from
    http://www.cs.man.ac.uk/~choif/software/C99-1.2-release.tgz
To run the software, you need java. java is available from
    http://www.blackdown.org/java-linux.html
Next, set CLASSPATH appropriately. For example, suppose that
C99-1.2-release.tgz and seg-1.21.tar.gz are expanded in
/home/tools, then add 
    setenv CLASSPATH /home/tools/naacl00Exp/bin/:/home/tools/seg-1.21
to ~/.cshrc and execute
    source ~/.cshrc
Then, you can run ESeg.
To run /home/tools/seg-1.21/Experiments, 
    cd /home/tools/seg-1.21
    ln -s /home/tools/naacl00Exp .
    csh Experiments
It should reproduce our experimental results in
/home/tools/seg-1.21/data/comp/*

The algorithm I wrote in my ACL/EACL-2001 paper is implemented
in vseg.c and seg.c. `Experiments' has the information from
which you can trace the programs I used for the experiments.
